# UMA Press Kit Assets

If you are looking for UMA `press-kit` assets, please see [`docs/press-kit`](https://github.com/UMAprotocol/website/tree/master/docs/press-kit).

# Instructions for Building UMAproject.org Source Code

## Dependencies

1. Latest version of [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/) (min v6.0.0)
2. Latest version of any of the following package managers

- [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) (min v5.3.0)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) (min v0.20.4)

## Install

In the root directory of the project run:

```
npm install
```

or

```
yarn install
```

If for some reason, NPM/Yarn throws errors and does not want to install the dependencies, please see https://goo.gl/iSz4w8.

TL;DR

Run

```
npm cache clean
```

If that does not fix the issue, manually remove everything in the `~/AppData/Roaming/npm-cache` folder.

MAC/Linux users should try and find another way to delete this folder's contents because they do not have access to this folder by default.

Then run the install script again.

## MAC OSX Setup

If you are using OSX, you need to run the following (only once):

1. `brew update`
2. `brew install libtool automake autoconf nasm`
3. `brew reinstall libpng`

## Linux setup

If you are using linux environment, you need to run the following (only once):

1. `sudo apt-get install libtool automake autoconf nasm`

## Development

To start the project in development mode, run:

```
npm start
```

or

```
yarn start
```

If you want to serve the files via your local server instead of the Browsersync server, run the start command and supply the development URL argument:

```
npm start -- --dev-url "http://your-server.url/path/to/project"
```

or

```
yarn start -- --dev-url "http://your-server.url/path/to/project"
```

## Build

To build the project, run:

```
npm run build
```

## Production

To build the project for production environment (e.g. minimize bundles css and js files and optimize images), run:

```
npm run prod
```

**NOTE**: the script `postprod` has been added to move the `build` folder to `docs`. This allows us to automatically host the site on GitHub Pages by pointing at the `/docs` folder.
