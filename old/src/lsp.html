            <h4>
              The UMA Long Short Pair (LSP) contract template allows for the
              creation of non-liquidatable and capped payout products via
              tokenized long and short positions. <br />
              <br />
              Developers can choose between a Binary, Linear, Covered Call and
              Range LSP contract templates.

        <h2 class="products-body-title">Who is it for?</h2>
        <p class="products-body-info">
          Engineers that want to create customized products that have a 0-1
          payout, suited for prediction markets or binary options.
        </p>
        <p class="products-body-info">
          Engineers that want to create long and short tokens with a variable
          payout based on where settlement occurs within a defined range (e.g.,
          KPI Options).
        </p>
        <p class="products-body-info">
          Engineers that want to create Covered Call Options whereby the
          contract pays out if a settlement price is above or below a defined
          strike price.
        </p>
        <p class="products-body-info">
          Projects interested in creating structured products enabling them to
          borrow stablecoins against their projectâ€™s native token while offering
          unique risk profiles to investors.
        </p>

        <h2 class="products-body-title">How is it better?</h2>
        <p class="products-body-info">
          Compared to EMP contracts on UMA, the LSP contracts are
          non-liquidatable and do not require running bots.
        </p>
        <p class="products-body-info">
          The dual token design means that sponsor positions are transferable.
        </p>
        <p class="products-body-info">
          Accommodates various financial payout types and products with minimal
          changes
        </p>
        <p class="products-body-info">
          Ability to use any collateral type without any security
          considerations, as the payout is denominated in units of collateral
          and is fully capitalized.
        </p>

        <h2 class="products-body-title">Examples</h2>
        <p class="products-body-info">
          A development team wants to express a crypto dominance pair. They
          create a LSP that expresses the relative value of an asset compared to
          the entire crypto market cap.
        </p>
        <p class="products-body-info">
          A booky launches a sports prediction market using the LSP contracts.
          The long/short tokens each represent the likelihood of the outcome of
          a particular game.
        </p>
        <p class="products-body-info">
          A stablecoin DAO uses the LSP to create a token that measures the
          divergence from its dollar peg and caps the payout at +/-20% to make
          it capital efficient.
