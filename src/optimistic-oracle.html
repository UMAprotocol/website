        <h2 class="products-body-title">Who is it for?</h2>
        <p class="products-body-info">
          DeFi projects whose users demand the highest level of financial
          security and recourse against exploits and errors.
        </p>
        <p class="products-body-info">
          L2 markets to ensure accurate resolution with very few calls to L1.
        </p>
        <p class="products-body-info">
          Prediction markets, options platforms, and other market types that
          need precise information to resolve.
        </p>

        <h2 class="products-body-title">How is it better?</h2>
        <p class="products-body-info">
          The OO has an inbuilt dispute resolution system, so any attempt to
          manipulate the oracle would trigger a dispute.
        </p>
        <p class="products-body-info">
          For L2 solutions, a cross-chain bridge can ensure efficient settlement
          and security for L2 products.
        </p>
        <p class="products-body-info">
          The OO resolves quickly in the vast majority of cases, and does so in
          a gas efficient manner.
        </p>

        <h2 class="products-body-title">Examples</h2>
        <p class="products-body-info">
          A prediction market creates bespoke markets based on real-world
          information and uses the OO to resolve its markets.
        </p>
        <p class="products-body-info">
          A developer creates a financial product based on real-world data such
          as stock prices and benefits from the OOâ€™s design that does not
          require a secured price feed.
        </p>
