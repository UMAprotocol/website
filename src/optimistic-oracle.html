            <h1>Optimistic Oracle</h1>

            <h4>
              UMA’s Optimistic Oracle allows contracts to quickly request and
              receive various types of data. The Optimistic Oracle acts as a
              generalized escalation game between contracts that initiate a
              request and UMA’s dispute resolution system known as the Data
              Verification Mechanism (DVM).
              <br />
              <br />
              Data proposed by the Optimistic Oracle will not be sent to the DVM
              unless it is disputed. This enables contracts to obtain
              information within any predefined length of time without the need
              to have the data recorded on-chain.

        <h2 class="products-body-title">Who is it for?</h2>
        <p class="products-body-info">
          DeFi projects whose users demand the highest level of financial
          security and recourse against exploits and errors.
        </p>
        <p class="products-body-info">
          Prediction markets, option platforms, and other market types that
          require precise information
        </p>
        <p class="products-body-info">
          dApps which require accurate data for long-tail assets
        </p>

        <h2 class="products-body-title">How is it better?</h2>
        <p class="products-body-info">
          Resolves requests accurately and quickly for various types of data
          (e.g., price information, outcomes of real-world events, long-tail
          assets, performance outcomes)
        </p>
        <p class="products-body-info">
          Constructed with a priceless contract design to minimize reliance on
          oracles, making contracts on UMA more secure, gas efficient and less
          prone to manipulation
        </p>
        <p class="products-body-info">
          Leverages UMA’s Data Verification Mechanism (DVM) as a backstop to
          resolve disputes; any attempt to manipulate the oracle triggers a
          dispute
        </p>
        <p class="products-body-info">
          Backed by economic guarantees around the cost of corrupting the DVM to
          ensure it will cost more to corrupt the oracle (i.e., obtain 51% or
          more UMA tokens) than the amount someone could profit from corrupting
          the oracle (i.e. stealing funds within contracts on UMA).
        </p>
        <p class="products-body-info">
          For L2 solutions, a cross-chain bridge can ensure efficient settlement
          and security for L2 products.
        </p>

        <h2 class="products-body-title">Examples</h2>
        <p class="products-body-info">
          A prediction market creates bespoke markets based on real-world
          information and uses the OO to resolve its markets.
        </p>
        <p class="products-body-info">
          A developer creates a financial product based on real-world data such
          as stock prices and benefits from the OO’s design that does not
          require a secured price feed.
        </p>
        <p class="products-body-info">
          An insurance provider wants to offer insurance on a space launch and
          uses the OO to report the outcome of the launch.
        </p>
