        <p class="products-body-info">
          Cash settled — At expiry, the sponsor of the options contract will pay
          any profit due to the holder, rather than take payment from the
          tokenholder.

        <h2 class="products-body-title">Examples</h2>
        <p class="products-body-info">
          A trader buys a call option with a strike price of $2,000 for 0.05
          ETH. They have the right to buy 1 ETH for $2,000. At the expiry,
          ETH/USD is at $2,500 and the delivery price is $2,500. In this case,
          the option is settled for $500 per 1 ETH. The trader’s account is
          credited with 0.2 ETH ($500/$2,500), and the seller’s account is
          debited with 0.2 ETH. The initial purchase price was 0.05 ETH;
          therefore, the trader’s profit is 0.15 ETH.
        </p>
        <p class="products-body-info">
          A DAO Treasury sells a call option with a strike price of 2,000 USD

          option expires worthless. The buyer lost 0.05 ETH, and the Treasury
          gained 0.05 ETH.
