            <h4>
              Call and Put options allow DAO treasuries to offer yield
              opportunities to tokenholders, as well as leverage opportunities
              to speculators. The options are traded against the project token,
              so DAOs can typically create liquidity without any opportunity
              cost.

        <h2 class="products-body-title">Who is it for?</h2>
        <p class="products-body-info">
          DAOs create these products and offer liquidity so tokenholders benefit
          from their features.
        </p>
        <p class="products-body-info">
          Community managers use them to offer incentive aligned bounties to
          builders, because they only pay out under certain positive
          circumstances.
        </p>
        <p class="products-body-info">
          Treasury managers sell them as a way to raise money with the treasury
          without selling at a bad price.
        </p>

        <h2 class="products-body-title">How is it better?</h2>
        <p class="products-body-info">
          DAOs can launch these products and pair them against their project
          token. This has no volume or other requirements as on a CEX.
        </p>
        <p class="products-body-info">
          Liquidity for these options can come straight from the otherwise idle
          treasury.
        </p>
        <p class="products-body-info">
          Call options can be offered as incentives. They can be offered more
          liberally than unrestricted tokens, since they will only cost the
          treasury anything if the token trading high.
        </p>

        <h2 class="products-body-title">Examples</h2>
        <p class="products-body-info">
          UMA creates a call option with a $25 strike. The community is offered
          these tokens as an incentive to increase awareness. The price rallies
          to $30, and each call option is worth $5 of UMA each.
        </p>
        <p class="products-body-info">
          Take the above example, except the token fails to rally. The call
          options expire valueless, and have no cost to the UMA treasury.
        </p>
