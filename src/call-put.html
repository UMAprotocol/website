        </p>
        <p class="products-body-info">
          Settlements occurs two hours after expiry (if there are no disputes).
        </p>
        <p class="products-body-info">
          Cash settled — At expiry, the sponsor of the options contract will pay
          any profit due to the holder, rather than take payment from the
          tokenholder.

        <h2 class="products-body-title">Examples</h2>
        <p class="products-body-info">
          A trader buys a call option with a strike price of $2,000 for 0.05
          ETH. They have the right to buy 1 ETH for $2,000. At the expiry,
          ETH/USD is at $2,500 and the delivery price is $2,500. In this case,
          the option is settled for $500 per 1 ETH. The trader’s account is
          credited with 0.2 ETH ($500/$2,500), and the seller’s account is
          debited with 0.2 ETH. The initial purchase price was 0.05 ETH;
          therefore, the trader’s profit is 0.15 ETH.
        </p>
        <p class="products-body-info">
          A DAO Treasury sells a call option with a strike price of 2,000 USD
          for 0.05 ETH. The delivery price at expiry is 1,999 USD. The call
          option expires worthless. The buyer lost 0.05 ETH, and the Treasury
          gained 0.05 ETH.
