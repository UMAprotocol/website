            <h4>
              Call and Put options allow DAO treasuries to offer yield
              opportunities to tokenholders, as well as leverage opportunities
              to speculators.<br />
              <br />
              The options are traded against the project token, so DAOs can
              create liquidity without any opportunity cost.

        <h2 class="products-body-title">Who is it for?</h2>
        <p class="products-body-info">
          DAOs create these products and offer liquidity with no opportunity
          cost, so tokenholders benefit from their features.
        </p>
        <p class="products-body-info">
          Community managers use them to offer incentive aligned bounties to
          builders.
        </p>
        <p class="products-body-info">
          Treasury managers sell them as a way to raise money with the treasury
          without selling at a bad price.
        </p>

        <h2 class="products-body-title">How is it better?</h2>
        <p class="products-body-info">
          DAOs can use their treasury to mint and provide liquidity for these
          products, with no need for another capital type.
        </p>
        <p class="products-body-info">
          The process to create these is permissionless and within the DAOâ€™s
          control, as compared to a centralized trading platform.
        </p>
        <p class="products-body-info">
          Call options can be offered as incentives. They can be offered more
          liberally than unrestricted tokens, since they will only cost the
          treasury anything if the token trading is high.
        </p>

        <h2 class="products-body-title">Examples</h2>
        <p class="products-body-info">
          Uniswap creates a put option on UNI with a $25 strike. A trader buys
          it for .05 UNI. At expiry, the price is $15 and the option is worth
          $10.
        </p>
        <p class="products-body-info">
          Take the above example, except the token fails to rally. The call
          options expire valueless, and have no cost to the UMA treasury.
        </p>
        <p class="products-body-info">
          For a put option, consider UNI creates a put option with a $25 strike.
          A trader buys it for .05 UNI. At expiry, the price is $15, and so the
          option is settled worth $10.
