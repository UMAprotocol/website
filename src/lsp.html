            <h4>
              The LSP contract template allows for the creation of
              non-liquidatable and capped payout products via tokenized long and
              short positions.
              <br />
              <br />
              Developers can choose between Binary, Linear, Covered Call and
              Range LSP contract templates.

        <h2 class="products-body-title">Why create a LSP token?</h2>
        <p class="products-body-info">
          Create customized products that have a 0-1 payout, suited for
          prediction markets or binary options.
        </p>
        <p class="products-body-info">
          Create long and short tokens with a variable payout based on where
          settlement occurs within a defined range (e.g. KPI Options).
        </p>
        <p class="products-body-info">
          Create Covered Call/Put Options whereby the payout is based on if a
          settlement price is above or below a defined strike price.
        </p>
        <p class="products-body-info">
          Create structured products enabling treasuries to borrow stablecoins
          against their projectâ€™s native token while offering unique risk
          profiles to investors.
        </p>

        <h2 class="products-body-title">How is it better?</h2>
        <p class="products-body-info">No risk of liquidation.</p>
        <p class="products-body-info">
          Does not require running liquidator and dispute bots.
        </p>
        <p class="products-body-info">
          Tokenized and transferable sponsor positions.
        </p>

        <h2 class="products-body-title">Examples</h2>
        <p class="products-body-info">
          A development team wants to express a crypto dominance pair. They
          create a LSP that expresses the relative value of an asset compared to
          the entire crypto market cap.
        </p>
        <p class="products-body-info">
          A booky launches a sports prediction market using the LSP contracts.
          The long/short tokens each represent the likelihood of the outcome of
          a particular game.
        </p>
        <p class="products-body-info">
          A stablecoin DAO uses the LSP to create a token that measures the
          divergence from its dollar peg and caps the payout at +/-20% to make
          it capital efficient.
