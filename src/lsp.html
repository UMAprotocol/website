            <h1>LSP Contract</h1>

            <h4>
              The UMA Long Short Pair (LSP) contract template allows for the
              creation of unliquidatable & capped-payout token products. The LSP
              contract powers call/put options, range tokens, and KPI Options;
              it can be customized in other ways.

        <h2 class="products-body-title">Who is it for?</h2>
        <p class="products-body-info">
          DAOs that want to avail themselves of UMAâ€™s suite of treasury
          management products.
        </p>
        <p class="products-body-info">
          Financial engineers that want to create customized products that have
          a 0-1 range payout, such as with prediction markets or binary options.
        </p>
        <p class="products-body-info">
          Developers who want to customize a financial product on UMA.
        </p>

        <h2 class="products-body-title">How is it better?</h2>
        <p class="products-body-info">
          Compared to EMP contracts on UMA, the LSP contracts are
          non-liquidatable and do not require running bots.
        </p>
        <p class="products-body-info">
          The dual token design means that sponsor positions are transferable.
        </p>

        <h2 class="products-body-title">Examples</h2>
        <p class="products-body-info">
          A development team wants to express a crypto dominance pair, and
          creates a LSP that expresses the relative value of an asset compared
          to the entire crypto marketcap.
        </p>
        <p class="products-body-info">
          A booky launches a sports prediction market using the LSP contracts.
          The long/short tokens each represent the likelihood of the outcome of
          a particular game.
        </p>
        <p class="products-body-info">
          A stablecoin DAO uses the LSP to create a token that measures the
          divergence from the peg, and caps the payout at +/-20% to make it
          capital efficient.
