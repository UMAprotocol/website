                      UMA’s mission is to make financial markets universally
                      accessible—unrestrained by censorship, pre-existing
                      financial and social capital, or beliefs and values. The
                      economic freedom created by universal market access
                      creates equal opportunity to pursue prosperity and build

                    <p>
                      Synthetic assets are collateral-backed tokens whose value
                      fluctuates depending on the tokens’ reference index.

                  <h4>Priceless Contracts</h4>

                  <div class="category__content">
                    <h6>What are priceless financial contracts?</h6>

                    <p>
                      UMA provides priceless financial contract templates for
                      developers to create any kind of financial contract.
                      Priceless contracts minimize on-chain oracle usage to
                      reduce the frequence and surface area for oracle attacks.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      The first set of priceless contracts enable developers to
                      create synthetic assets. Up until now, synthetic token
                      designs have required smart contracts to know the value of
                      its collateral at all times, as reported by an on-chain
                      price feed. “Priceless” synthetic tokens differ because
                      they do not require an on-chain price feed to indicate
                      whether the contract is properly collateralized. Instead,
                      they have a liquidation mechanism that allows anyone to
                      liquidate an undercollateralized position.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      In this design, liquidators can choose to liquidate
                      positions based on their own off-chain view of the
                      reference index for the token, which informs their view on
                      whether the position is properly collateralized. Positions
                      that have not been liquidated are assumed to be properly
                      collateralized.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Liquidators are kept honest by disputers who are rewarded
                      for catching invalid liquidations. Only when a liquidation
                      is disputed is an oracle needed. UMA’s priceless financial
                      contract templates leverage a decentralized oracle service
                      known as the Data Verification Mechanism (DVM). This
                      system of incentives functions to minimize oracle usage
                      while keeping the entire system correctly collateralized.

                    <h6>What is UMA’s Optimistic Oracle?</h6>

                    <p>
                      UMA’s priceless contracts leverage an optimistic oracle
                      known as the Data Verification Mechanism (DVM). The DVM
                      provides the price of an asset at a requested timestamp
                      <b>only</b> when network participants dispute the value of
                      collateral backing a synthetic token. This differs from
                      non-optimistic oracle solutions which constantly write
                      prices on-chain to ensure contracts are properly
                      collateralized. Minimizing oracle usage increases the
                      security and scalability of decentralized financial
                      contracts.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      When a dispute occurs, the DVM aggregates price data
                      submitted by UMA token holders. UMA token holders respond
                      to price requests by referencing the asset's price
                      off-chain and reporting the price to the DVM. This price
                      is used as an input by the DVM to determine the final
                      price of the asset.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      If the price returned by the DVM determines the disputer
                      was correct, the disputer is rewarded with a penalty
                      charged to the liquidator; conversely if the disputer was
                      incorrect, the disputer forfeits a bond to the liquidator.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      UMA's DVM is backed by economic guarantees to ensure it
                      price feeds cannot be corrupted. Learn more
