              Token projects and DAOs give away or sell KPI Option tokens which
              are based on a “Key Performance Indicator.” The options are backed
              by the project’s token, but are only redeemable if the defined KPI
              is hit.

        <h2 class="products-body-title">Who is it for?</h2>
        <p class="products-body-info">
          DAOs airdrop them to help achieve their desired outcomes, like trade
          volume or locked value.
        </p>
        <p class="products-body-info">
          Ecosystem fund managers use them to bootstrap new communities or
          energize existing ones.
        </p>
        <p class="products-body-info">
          Treasurers use them to diversify risk by selling them, and only paying
          out the tokens if success criteria are met.
        </p>

        <h2 class="products-body-title">How is it better?</h2>
        <p class="products-body-info">
          Centralized performance payouts are trusted and are not tradable
          Unrestricted airdrops are often dumped and dilute token supply,
          regardless of if foundation goals are met.
        </p>
        <p class="products-body-info">
          The psychological impact of a shared upside invigorates communities.

          They are secured by UMA’s optimistic oracle. Recipients know they will
          pay out as expected.
        </p>

        <h2 class="products-body-title">Examples</h2>
        <p class="products-body-info">
          A new project uses KPI Options to bootstrap their new community. They
          airdrop to groups of people they want to attract, and give everyone a
          shared goal to join and achieve the project’s target.
        </p>
        <p class="products-body-info">
          A DAO uses KPI Options to increase the adoption of their new trading
          product. They airdrop the KPI Options to users of their competitor’s
          project, thus providing them with an incentive to switch.
