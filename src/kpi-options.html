            <h4>
              KPI Options are incentive mechanisms that pay out more rewards if
              a defined KPI grows before a given expiry date. Every KPI option
              holder has an incentive to improve that KPI because their option
              will be worth more. This is intended to align individual
              tokenholder interests with the collective interests of the
              protocol.

              <br />
