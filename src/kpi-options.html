              KPI options are synthetic tokens that pay out more rewards if a
              "Key Performance Indicator" grows before a given expiry date.
              <br />
              DAOs can use them to motivate their communities and to help
              achieve protocol objectives.

        <h2 class="products-body-title">Who is it for?</h2>
        <p class="products-body-info">
          DAOs airdrop them to help achieve protocol growth targets, such as
          trade volume or locked value.
        </p>
        <p class="products-body-info">
          Ecosystem fund managers use them to bootstrap new communities or
          energize existing ones.
        </p>
        <p class="products-body-info">
          Off-chain organizations use them to help achieve distributed goals,
          such as university matriculation or vaccination rates.
        </p>

        <h2 class="products-body-title">How is it better?</h2>
        <p class="products-body-info">
          Centralized performance payouts are trusted and are not tradable.
        </p>
        <p class="products-body-info">
          Unrestricted airdrops are often dumped and dilute token supply,
          regardless of if foundation goals are met.
        </p>
        <p class="products-body-info">
          The psychological impact of a shared upside invigorates communities.

          They are secured by UMA’s optimistic oracle. Recipients know they will
          pay out as expected.

        <h2 class="products-body-title">Examples</h2>
        <p class="products-body-info">
          A new project uses KPI Options to bootstrap their new community. They
          airdrop to groups of people they want to attract, and give everyone a
          shared goal to join and achieve the project’s target.
        </p>
        <p class="products-body-info">
          A DAO uses KPI Options to increase the adoption of their new trading
          product. They airdrop the KPI Options to users of their competitor’s
          project, thus providing them with an incentive to switch.
