            <h4>
              A range token is a treasury primitive that enables DAOs to access
              funds and diversify their treasury without directly selling their
              native tokens. <br />

              DAOs can use their native tokens as collateral to borrow funds
              with no risk of liquidation.

        <h2 class="products-body-title">Who is it for?</h2>
        <p class="products-body-info">
          DAOs with outsized treasuries in their native token, who have high
          exposure to market swings.
        </p>
        <p class="products-body-info">
          Treasury managers who want to borrow stablecoins against a project
          token without the immediate regulatory implications of conducting a
          sale.
        </p>
        <p class="products-body-info">
          DAOs that need to prepare their treasury by diversifying. This ensures
          they can fund their operations and achieve their protocol objectives.
        </p>

        <h2 class="products-body-title">How is it better?</h2>
        <p class="products-body-info">
          DAOs can add stablecoins to their balance sheet without having to
          conduct a token sale, which can cause immeidate sell pressure and
          regulatory concerns.
        </p>
        <p class="products-body-info">
          This mechanism ensures that tokens are not sold too cheaply, while
          offering an attractive yield to farmers.
        </p>
        <p class="products-body-info">
          This mechanism is available to any DAO in a decentralized way, without
          any jurisdictional or centralized authority hoops to jump through.
        </p>

        <h2 class="products-body-title">Examples</h2>
        <p class="products-body-info">
          UNI needs to diversify its treasury because its holdings are almost
          entirely denominated in its native token, so it creates a range bond
          to raise $10M today without any immediate $UNI sell pressure.
        </p>
        <p class="products-body-info">
          A DAO wants to offer a loan to developer teams building token projects
          on their protocol, and does so by purchasing range tokens from the
          teams.
